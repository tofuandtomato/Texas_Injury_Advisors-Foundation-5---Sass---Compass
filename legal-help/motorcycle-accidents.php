					<p>Have you been injured in a motorcycle accident?</p>
					<p>Unlike a car, truck or SUV, which offer a cocoon of protection to the driver and passengers, motorcycles leave the driver and passenger totally exposed. This, combined with the small size of motorbikes, can result in some very serious accidents that may involve permanent disability or even death.</p>
					<p>At Texas Injury Advisors, we'll connect you with a team of talented and experienced Dallas-Fort Worth attorneys, specializing in personal injury cases and wrongful death suits.</p>
					<p><b>How Do Motorcycle Accidents Occur?</b></p>
					<p>Motorcycles are especially prone to accidents are a result of their small size. This makes the motorcyclist more difficult to see. Others may fail to yield.</p>
					<p>As with other accidents, the at-fault driver may also be distracted, drunk or intoxicated with drugs, or simply negligent.</p>
					<p><b>Motorcycle Accident Injuries</b></p>
					<p>Whatever the cause of the crash, motorcycle accidents can lead to serious injuries, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>road rash lacerations and cuts;</li>
						<li>fractures and broken bones;</li>
						<li>amputations;</li>
						<li>contusions;</li>
						<li>severe burns;</li>
						<li>head injuries; and</li>
						<li>spinal cord injuries.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These injuries are often far more severe because even with protective clothing and helmets, the rider is very exposed. The bike offers no protection in the event of an impact and the rider often goes airborne, resulting in very serious injuries.</p>
					<p>Motorcycle accidents can lead to long-term or permanent disability, sky high medical bills and extensive rehabilitation and assistive care expenses.</p>
					<p>If you've been involved in a motorcycle crash, you may be eligible to receive compensation from the individual who's at-fault for the crash. This compensation may also cover lost wages, property damage and pain and suffering. But you need an experienced Texas motorcycle accident attorney working to represent your interests.</p>

					<p><b>How to Minimize the Risk of a Motorcycle Crash</b></p>
					<p>Motorcyclists can take several steps to minimize the chances of a crash, especially those involving serious injuries, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ride in optimal conditions --- that is, daylight and good weather conditions, without rain, fog or other inclement weather.</li>
						<li>Wear a helmet, protective eyewear and protective clothing to limit the injury if you're involved in a crash.</li>
						<li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times and work to anticipate other drivers' actions.</li>
						<li>Assume other drivers don't realize you're present. Also, avoid riding in a vehicle's blind spot.</li>
						<li>Avoid rural roads, as statistics indicate that a majority of motorcycle accidents occur on so-called back roads.</li>
						<li>Use hand signals in addition to a turning signal. Motorcycle turn signals are often very small and difficult to see.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These steps will help minimize your chances of suffering injury in a motorcycle crash.</p>
