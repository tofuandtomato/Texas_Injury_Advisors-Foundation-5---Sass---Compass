					<p><b>Common Construction Site Injuries</b></p>
					<p>Construction sites are filled with a range of different hazards and potentially deadly conditions involving:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>slips and falls</li>
						<li>electrocution</li>
						<li>crushing injuries</li>
						<li>cuts and amputation</li>
						<li>broken bones</li>
						<li>burns</li>
						<li>....and beyond</li>
					</ul>
					<p>From falling debris, to equipment malfunctions or an accidental fall from a ladder, there are many dangers that can lead to serious injuries, permanent disability and even death.</p>
					<p><b>Can Construction Accidents Be Avoided?</b></p>
					<p>Some construction site accidents are unforeseeable and truly accidental, while other (preventable) incidents are the result of negligence or a lack of training.</p>
					<p>Accidents may occur as the result of poorly maintained tools or equipment, while others may arise due to failure to provide or wear safety equipment. Injuries involving people who are passing through or by a work area may arise as the result of poorly erected fencing or a lack of proper signage.</p>
					<p>Whatever the case, the construction company may be liable for any damages that result from injury or death.</p>

					<p><b>Construction Accidents and Product Liability</b></p>
					<p>A defective or poorly constructed/designed tool or equipment can result in very serious accidents and even fatal injuries on a construction site. In these cases, the manufacturer may be liable for any damages that occur as a result of that defective or poorly designed item.</p>
					<p>Whether it's a safety harness, a hand tool, vehicle or other item, you may be entitled to damages if the accident arises as a result of poor design/construction or a defect.</p>
					<p>Many different individuals may be liable in the case of a construction site accident, including product manufacturers, suppliers/distributors, retailers, contractors or subcontractors.</p>
					<p>You can guarantee that the company will have a qualified team of attorneys representing their interests, so you must protect your interests. That's precisely where a Dallas-Fort Worth personal injury attorney can assist.</p>
