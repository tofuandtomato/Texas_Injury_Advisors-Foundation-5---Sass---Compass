	              		<p>Have you been injured in a car accident? At Texas Injury Advisors, we assist residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth area as they work to seek compensation following an accident.</p>
	              		<p><b>Types of Damages</b></p>
	              		<p>Car accidents can involve several different types of damages that may entitle you to compensation.</p>	
	              		<p>If you suffered property damage, you may need to file suit in order to seek compensation to cover repair or replacement costs for your vehicle, home or business.</p>
	              		<p>Personal injury damages are the second form of damages that you may suffer following a car crash. Concussions and head injuries, along with back, neck and spinal cord injuries are among the most common and serious injuries that may result from a car crash.</p>
	              		<p>Whatever the nature of the injury, there may be costs associated with medical bills, time spent out of work and miscellaneous expenses. You may also be entitled to a settlement that covers the losses and expenses associated with permanent or long term disability.</p>
	              		<p><b>Compensation and Settlements</b></p>
	              		<p>If you're in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and have a personal injury case stemming from an auto accident, you may be eligible to receive compensation to cover expenses such as:</p>
	              		<ul>

	              		</ul>
	              		<p>In the case of a fatal accident, the deceased individual's surviving family members may receive compensation by filing of a wrongful death suit against the at-fault party.</p>
	              		<p>Depending upon the precise nature of the situation, your own insurance company or the other at-fault driver's insurance company may be liable. Each case is unique, but our legal experts can help Dallas-Fort Worth natives with a free consultation.</p>

					<p><b>I've Been in an Accident. What Should I Do?</b></p>
					<p>If you're involved in a car crash, it's important to move to a safe area if possible and contact the police department to assist. You must obtain the other driver's name, contact information and insurance information. If there are witnesses on- scene, it's also wise to get their name and contact information.</p>
					<p>If possible, take photos and/or video of the scene to document the damage and the position of each vehicle. It's also advisable to visit the police department (or the PD's website) in the city where the accident occurred to fill out an accident report. This documentation is important.</p>
					<p>Immediately following a car accident, it's essential to seek out appropriate medical care to maximize your chances of recovery while reducing your chances of suffering permanent or prolonged disability.</p>
					<p>After you've sought treatment, you can contact your insurance company to report the crash.</p>
					<p>Once this is complete, Dallas-Fort Worth drivers are encouraged to contact the experts at Texas Injury Advisors! We'll ensure you meet with a qualified personal attorney for a consultation regarding your case.</p>
