					<h4>Have you been injured in a slip and fall accident?</h4>			
					<p>Slip and falls can leave you with broken bones, neck and back injuries, or even head trauma.</p>		
					<p>What's more, slip and fall cases can virtually always be avoided. This means there's someone who may be liable for your injuries, but that's exactly where Texas Injury Attorneys can help. We'll connect you with a seasoned Dallas-Fort Worth personal injury attorney who can represent your interests, while working to help you recover what's rightfully owed to you.</p>
					<p><b>What Causes a Slip and Fall Accident?</b></p>
					<p>A slip and fall can occur as a result of spilled liquids, flooring that has just been mopped, freezing conditions or an area of damaged flooring, steps or walkway.</p>
					<p>Whatever the precise situation, the property owner or company that's operating at the location is liable and responsible for ensuring that the flooring and walkways are safe at all times.</p>
					<p>Slip and fall incidents virtually always involve negligence on the part of the property owner or company that's operating at the site. This negligence can take many forms, such as failing to maintain a walkway or stairs or failure to erect wet floor signs.</p>
					<p><b>What Happens After a Slip and Fall Accident?</b></p>
					<p>Following a slip and fall accident, it's essential to seek immediate medical assistance to ensure you're treated appropriately.</p>
					<p>If possible, photograph and/or videotape the accident scene and get the name and contact information from any witnesses to the event.</p>
					<p>It's also wise to contact a personal injury attorney immediately, as an at-fault company or property owner may not preserve surveillance video if it's beneficial to your claim. An attorney can work to ensure that this valuable footage is properly preserved.</p>
					<p>In addition, beware that a private investigator may contact you on behalf of the company or property owner. Never speak to an investigator without your attorney present as your words could be misconstrued in a manner that harms your rightful claim to compensation.</p>
