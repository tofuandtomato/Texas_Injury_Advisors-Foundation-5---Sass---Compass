					<p>Have you been injured while walking or while riding a bike? Drivers are required to stop for pedestrians in a crosswalk, but this doesn't always occur, resulting in serious injury or even death.</p>
					<p>If you or a loved one has been injured while walking, cycling, skateboarding or rollerblading, you may be eligible to receive compensation to cover the costs of medical bills, lost wages and other related expenses.</p>
					<p>The professional team at Texas Injury Advisors works with Dallas-Fort Worth pedestrian accident victims, connecting them with an experienced personal injury attorney who can provide an evaluation of your case.</p>
					<p><b>Injuries Resulting From Pedestrian Accidents</b></p>
					<p>Pedestrian accidents (and accidents that occur while on a bike, skateboard or rollerblades) can lead to very serious injuries. In fact, they're often more serious than car versus car accidents, as there's no protective structure surrounding the pedestrian.</p>
					<p>Severe injury, permanent disability and even death are relatively common in the realm of pedestrian accidents, which number in the thousands each year. Neck and spinal cord injuries, broken bones and head trauma are among the most common injuries that arise from a car versus pedestrian crash.</p>
					<p><b>Investigating a Pedestrian Accident</b></p>
					<p>The investigation process is extremely important in the case of an accident involving a pedestrian. The victim's personal injury lawyer must offer proof that the driver was negligent in some way. This negligence can take many forms, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>speeding;</li>
						<li>driver distraction;</li>
						<li>defective equipment; or</li>
						<li>impairment due to drugs/alcohol.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Witnesses are absolutely essential in a personal injury case involving a pedestrian accident. The police department typically conducts an on-scene investigation as well.</p>
					<p>If a commercial vehicle or trucking company was involved in the crash, it's common for a private investigator to contact the victim. In these cases, it's best to decline comment without representation from your attorney to avoid jeopardizing your case.</p>
					<p>Your remarks could be misconstrued or used against you as you seek compensation to cover the costs associated with medical bills, lost wages and other losses.</p>

					<p><b>Bike Accidents</b></p>
					<p>Accidents involving bicyclists can be especially tricky, as bicyclists must follow many of the same rules as motor vehicles, yet the operator is unprotected and vulnerable like a pedestrian.</p>
					<p>Bicyclists must stop at stop signs and red lights; they must also yield to oncoming traffic, yet when confronted by a vehicle, the bike maintains a right of way, just like a pedestrian.</p>
					<p>Drivers may be liable if they cause injury to a cyclist as the result of negligence. If adverse weather conditions or roadway conditions were a factor, the city or town may be named as a defendant in the case.</p>
					<p>If you've been injured while bicycling, walking, running, skateboarding or rollerblading, you may be eligible to receive compensation.</p>
					<p>The other side will have qualified attorneys to represent their interests; you must protect your interests as well. Texas Injury Advisors will connect you with a Dallas-Fort Worth personal injury attorney to discuss your case.</p>
